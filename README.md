# Learning-Log
An online journal system for users to keep track of information on particular topics.


Using Heroku, a Platform as a Service cloud platform, I created a learning log for users to keep track of their understanding on their topic of choice. This proejct is deployed on Heroku's servers so anyone is able to access it.
